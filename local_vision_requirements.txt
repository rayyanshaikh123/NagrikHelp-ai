# Core ML backend: pin torch to a stable release. We avoid pinning
# torchvision/torchaudio here because they're not required by the server
# and pinning mismatched versions caused Docker/Render resolution errors.
# The Render build will consult the PyTorch wheel index to fetch compatible
# manylinux wheels when available.
# Ensure NumPy 1.x is used (torch and many native extensions are built
# against NumPy 1.x). Using NumPy 2.x can break prebuilt binaries. We
# pin to the 1.x series while still allowing minor updates.
numpy>=1.24,<2.0
torch==2.2.0

# Optional extras (install locally if you need them):
# pip install torchvision torchaudio --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
