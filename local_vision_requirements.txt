# Core ML backend: pin torch to a stable release. We avoid pinning
# torchvision/torchaudio here because they're not required by the server
# and pinning mismatched versions caused Docker/Render resolution errors.
# The Render build will consult the PyTorch wheel index to fetch compatible
# manylinux wheels when available.
# Ensure NumPy is installed before torch so torch can initialize NumPy's
# C-API properly during import on the host environment.
numpy>=1.25.0

# Use NumPy 1.x series to remain compatible with many prebuilt PyTorch wheels
numpy>=1.24,<2.0

# YOLOv8 for object detection
ultralytics>=8.0.0

# OpenCV for image processing (required by YOLO)
opencv-python>=4.8.0

# NOTE: torch is installed during the Render build (see render.yaml) using
# the official PyTorch wheel index to ensure a compatible binary wheel is
# selected for the build environment. Keeping `torch` out of this file
# avoids pip resolving platform-specific local-version suffixes here.

# Optional extras (install locally if you need them):
# pip install torchvision torchaudio --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
